Recipe
To make about 12 pancakes you need:
100g plain flour
2 large eggs
300ml milk
15ml of oil, plus extra for frying
a pinch of salt
1. Put the flour, milk, oil and pinch of salt into a bowl. Whisk them together, then add the eggs
and whisk again until you have a smooth liquid called batter.
2. Leave the batter to rest for 30 minutes if you have time.
3. Put a medium-size frying pan over medium heat and put a little oil in the pan.
4. When the oil is hot, pour a large spoonful of batter into the pan and move the pan so that
the batter covers the bottom of the pan.
5. Cook the pancakes for one minute on each side until they are golden.
6. Serve the pancakes warm with the topping you like best.
